# Writing on systems and scale

This space is a public archive of my writing on how systems work at scale — from organisations and execution environments to economic and institutional structures.

The focus is on:
- systems and coordination
- execution under constraints
- structural economic questions
- scale, incentives, and outcomes

All essays here are exploratory and explanatory in nature, aimed at understanding problems before proposing solutions.
