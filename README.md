# Sarim Islam — Research & Policy Writing Portfolio

This repository presents my research and analytical writing on India’s external sector, exchange rate dynamics, and long-term economic structure.

My work examines India’s recurring currency pressure through a **structural Balance of Payments lens**, focusing on how foreign exchange is earned, financed, and absorbed over time. Across papers and articles, I analyse the roles of export composition, manufacturing capability, and the limitations of services-led growth and capital inflows in anchoring external stability.

## Core Research Thesis

India’s repeated episodes of rupee depreciation reflect a structural external-sector constraint rather than a sequence of isolated cyclical shocks.

While capital inflows have enabled the financing of current account deficits, they have not altered the underlying configuration of foreign exchange generation. Over time, this has left the currency sensitive to global financial conditions and external shocks.

A durable anchor for currency stability requires a structurally stronger export base—particularly in manufacturing—that generates scalable and resilient foreign exchange earnings. This research programme studies why services-led growth and capital inflows, while important, are insufficient on their own to perform this role.

## Working Papers

### Why India’s Rupee Pressure Is Structural, Not Cyclical  
SSRN Working Paper

This paper develops a conceptual framework for understanding recurring pressure on the Indian rupee by distinguishing between cyclical triggers and deeper external-sector characteristics. It reframes currency weakness as a structural outcome of how foreign exchange is generated and financed over time.

## Analytical Articles (Research Arc)

These articles form a connected analytical arc examining India’s external-sector structure, with particular emphasis on export composition, manufacturing capability, and long-term currency stability.

**Published**
- **Financing the Imbalance: Capital Inflows and India’s Currency Stability**  
  Examines how reliance on volatile capital inflows finances India’s current account deficit without providing durable currency stability.

**In Progress**
- **Export Composition and External Stability: Evidence from India’s Balance of Payments**  
  Analyses why the composition of exports, rather than export volume alone, is central to long-term external-sector resilience and recurring rupee pressure.

**Planned (as part of the same research arc)**
- Manufacturing-led exports and foreign exchange generation in the Indian economy  
- Structural limits of services-led export growth and implications for external balance  
- Manufacturing-led external stability under global shocks (comparative perspective)  
- Structural constraints on manufacturing-led external stability, including energy dependence and global value chains  
- A structural synthesis of trade, capital, and energy constraints shaping long-term external stability in India

## Flagship Working Paper (In Progress)

**India’s Persistent Rupee Depreciation: A Structural Balance of Payments Perspective**

This paper synthesises the insights from the article series into a unified structural analysis of India’s external sector. It combines conceptual framing, stylised facts, and comparative insights to examine the long-term drivers of currency pressure and external vulnerability.

## Work in Progress

- Completion of a flagship structural analysis of India’s external sector  
- Ongoing analytical article series on export composition, manufacturing, and external stability  
- Preparation for research associate and policy research fellowship roles
