# Analytical Articles

This section contains analytical articles that form a connected research arc examining India’s external-sector structure and long-term currency stability.

The articles focus on how foreign exchange is earned and financed over time, with particular emphasis on export composition, capital inflows, manufacturing capability, and structural constraints on external stability. Together, they feed into a larger flagship working paper on India’s persistent rupee depreciation.

## In Progress

### Export Composition and External Stability: Evidence from India’s Balance of Payments
Analyses why the composition of exports, rather than export volume alone, plays a central role in shaping long-term external-sector resilience and recurring currency pressure.

## Planned (as part of the same research arc)

- Manufacturing-led exports and foreign exchange generation in the Indian economy  
- Structural limits of services-led export growth and implications for external balance
